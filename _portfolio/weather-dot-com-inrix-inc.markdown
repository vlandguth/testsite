At INRIX, I worked on a connected car software called OpenCar. I created a styleguide for the design team to use to streamline our process and maintain consistency across the different screens we were designing for. This required me to be very detail oriented and hyper focused on making each screen pixel perfect and well organized.
I designed a Weather.com experience for OpenCar which required researching the website contents and deciding what would be relevant to a driver. I created an information architecture and wireframes based on my research. Then I used the styleguide I made, to create visuals and a prototype version to present to the stakeholders.
